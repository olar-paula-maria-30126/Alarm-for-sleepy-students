# Alarm-for-sleepy-students
For many of us, waking up in the morning can be one of the biggest challenges of the day. Thatâ€™s why I created an interactive alarm using the Arduino development platform.  
Once the alarm is triggered, a mathematical operation is displayed on the LCD screen, which the user must solve to stop the alarm. Otherwise, it will continue ringing until the correct answer is entered.
